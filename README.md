# Event-Pattern-Matching-in-Football
The aim of this project is to match similar events that happened in football matches (such as passes or shots). The dataset for the project contained around 4.7 million events from several popular football leagues (such as the Premier League and La Liga).
Summary of methodologies:
•	Created a scalable database using MongoDB to store the events from matches and their relevant information.
•	Created indexes that helped in querying the data efficiently. 
•	Used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to match football events patterns (using the Python library fastdtw).
•	Evaluated the results by visualizing the patterns of football events on a football pitch plot (using Python libraries: mplsoccer and matplotlib).
•	Project link:
